# Reporting Transit

## What is the Reporting Transit?

The Reporting Transit is a Python script designed to generate detailed reports on AWS Transit Gateways. It provides comprehensive information about transit gateways, their attachments, and associated routes, which can be vital for managing and auditing network infrastructure.

## Why Use It?

- **Centralized Information**: It consolidates data from multiple AWS accounts and regions into a single, coherent report.
- **Auditing**: Facilitates compliance and security audits by providing a clear overview of network configurations.
- **Troubleshooting**: Helps identify and resolve network issues by visualizing the transit gateway connections and routes.
- **Documentation**: Generates documentation that can be used for knowledge sharing and operational purposes.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Account Support**: Capable of assuming roles across different AWS accounts to gather comprehensive data.
- **Detailed Reports**: Provides detailed information about each transit gateway, including attachments and associated routes.
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Generates reports in JSON, CSV, and Markdown formats to suit different use cases and tools.
- **Automated**: Simplifies the process of collecting and reporting transit gateway data, saving time and reducing manual effort.

## Limitations

- **Permissions**: Requires appropriate permissions to access transit gateway information across all targeted AWS accounts and regions.
- **Regional Constraints**: Data is collected per region, which means the script must be run for each region where transit gateways are present.
- **Complexity**: The script assumes familiarity with AWS and Python, which might be a barrier for some users.

## Data

### JSON Output

The JSON output provides a detailed, structured view of the transit gateways, attachments, and routes.
